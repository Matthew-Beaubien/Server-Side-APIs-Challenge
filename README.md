## Server Side APIs Challenge/Weather Dashboard

A simple weather dashboard using the OpenWeather API to fetch weather information for the user inputed location. Displays data for the current day as well as the following days.

NOTE: After reading through the important notice before the submit box, I should state that I have used many resources to come to this final product. Unfortunately many of the links are lost or forgotten due to the large timeframe in which I had been working on the project. I apologize for any inconvience or problems this may cause.
